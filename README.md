## Introduction

Welcome to the Internet Engineering course repository on GitHub! This repository is a central location for all the materials related to the course, including lecture notes, assignments, code samples, and other resources to help you learn the fundamental concepts of internet engineering.

Internet engineering is a multidisciplinary field that involves the design, development, and management of internet-based systems and applications. The field covers topics from backend to frontend development. This is technological course, so its materials may be deprecated soon, or they may be related only to specific technologies. In this course, you will learn the basics of internet engineering, including the principles of networking, protocols, and architectures. You will also have the opportunity to explore various web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learn how to design and develop web applications.

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing resources related to a particular topic or aspect of internet engineering. You will find lecture notes, slides, and code samples in the "lectures" folder, while assignments and projects will be located in the "assignments" folder. There is also a "resources" folder that contains additional materials such as books, papers, and links to useful online resources.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for you throughout the course and beyond. Let's explore the exciting world of internet engineering together!
