# what do we do now? Manual version controlling by programmer

![](images/trad.png)

# problems

-   copy-paste/save-as whole project after every stable build
-   what if more than 1 developer work at the same time?
-   which version was stable?
-   all files are unnecessary while saving as?

# benefits of version control

-   easily management collaboration on a project
-   ability to have unlimited number of developers
-   easily revert back your files if something went wrong

# git features

-   free and open source
-   distributed
-   non-linear (branches)
-   handle large projects efficiently

# how to use git

1. search!
2. I search too
3. everybody else does search too

# file status life cycle

![](https://slideplayer.com/slide/13332433/80/images/17/Git+file+lifecycle.jpg)

# Github

-   instagram for git

-   a place to keep git projects, review them, fork them, star them.

-   alternatives: gitlab, bitbucket, any other place

#### gist: some part of code to share with others

# Push? Remote? Clone?

-   remote: where should I upload my git projects
-   push: act of uploading gits
-   clone: download whole git
-   pull: check for updates in the remote git

# .gitignore, .git

-   .git: local and hidden folder that contains git internal files, don't open it!

-   delete .git folder in case of removing git from project

-   .gitignore: ignore these sort of files

```
*.class
.idea/
__pycache__/
```

#### do not commit large and binary files! Why?

# is git running in background?

+ background process?
+ what is **tracking** mean?



# branch

![](https://www.nobledesktop.com/image/gitresources/git-branches-merge.png)

+ keep master branch stable
+ development branch
+ feature branch 
+ bug-fix branch

# merge conflict

+ what if we can merge?
+ some developers changed same file
+ somebody should combine changes
+ with help of merge-tool

# checkout 

+ switch another branch 
+ view an old commit
+ reset a file to a specific commit version

![checkuot](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-checkout.png)



# tag

+ commits doesn't have a name 
+ specify special commits 
+ which commit is last working version?
+ how to handle versions? 

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/638/1*CW-G-2zVFpEfEZNOTBvT0g.jpeg)



# amend

+ re-writing history 
+ change commit message 
+ change commited fils

### don't rewrite history (especially for published commits)



# stash 

+ save uncommitted changes 
+ different options for uncommitted, ignored, staged 

![](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-stash.png)





# revert

+ undo last commit changes

+ with a brand-new commit

# bisect

![](https://files.virgool.io/upload/users/195916/posts/kiybjsojv6cf/amufcdey5v9x.png)





# rebase 

+ instead of merge
+ combine history with adding old commits 
+ interactive mode: select some commits
+ be careful: might re-write history 

![rebase](https://miro.medium.com/max/603/1*75GIyh005_Wl9vRQF3tgTQ.png)

# squash 

+ not a git command 
+ a term in using rebase
+ group specific changes to one commit 



# cherry-pick

+ add other branch's commit to current branch

# git flow 

+ whats masters do with git branches?

+ set of rules to use branching better

  ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/2880/1*9yJY7fyscWFUVRqnx0BM6A.png)

  

  + Master is production ready

  - Master is deployed to production
  - Development happens in a development branch, which in turn has feature branches
  - Deploy when the development of a release is finished and validated
  - Requires a validation for each release

+ automated tools: set of aliases

+ nothing to worry about






# common commands

```bash
# first time initialize
git config --global user.name "Bugs Bunny"
git config --global user.email bugs@gmail.com
git init


# regulary code and commit
git status
git add -A # or git add filename
git commit -m 'commit message'

# work with remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-account/your-repository.git
git push origin master # push from master branch to origin remote
git pull # get new updates
git clone https://github.com/sb-acc/some-repo.git

# see old commits (and other beautiful versions of this command)
git log
git log --abbrev-commit --pretty=oneline
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --abbrev-commit

# work with history
git checkout branchname # change HEAD to another commit/branch
git reset --hard HEAD # revert to last commit
git diff HEAD # what is changed from head
git checkout HEAD filename # revert filename to last commit

git blame filename # who changed this file

# stash
git stash # save uncommited changes and revert repository to commited sate
git stash list
git stash pop # pop last saved stash


# tag
git tag tagname -am 'tag message' # create new tag
git tag # list all tags
git push --tags


# merge
git config --global merge.tool meld # meld or another app
git checkout destination
git merge source
git mergetool # open the merge tool

# get help 
curl http:/cheat.sh/git
man git-add
info git-add


rm -rf .git # get rid of git!
```



# conclusion

+ search
+ read help & documentation
+ don't fear
+ everything messed up: re-clone whole project and delete current folder
+ test new command in a toy repository
+ don't commit large files
+ don't re-write public history 
+ pull before push, pull before start coding
+ alias for your useful command could be good
